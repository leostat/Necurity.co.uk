	Welcome to Necurity, come in sit down and put your feet up, this website is still very much in development so excuse the mess! Over the next few months this site will take shape to host allsorts of "interesting" articles around networking and security. It will act as a mini journal as I progress throughout the field of informaition security. Its been a project that has been gathering dust so ive given it new life, a facelift and here we are now!. If you have any requests for topics let me know!
