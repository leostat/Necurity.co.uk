title: Kickstarts and Configuration Management Tutorial
category: netsec
date: 2013-10-22
tags: spacewalk management standardisation
summary:
 Spacewalk offers the ability to generate and deploy Kickstarts (standard builds) and also is able to keep a eye on packages that are installed on the system as well as compare any file that is on the remote machine to a local copy, giving IT management a overview of which if any systems do not meet a standard build requirement. In this tutorial I will go about first creating a Kickstart of a CentOS 6.4 Laptop, the generation of the standard profile and finally the creation, deployment and comparison of system files.

The establishment of standards and baselines in a enterprise environment is a important step toward improving information security controls. It allows the assurance that all systems used within the business meet the minimum security requirements, while saving IT staff time on building and installing machines.
