First things first though is I would like to highlight that the CPSA exam is under both the <a href http://www.crest-approved.org/wp-content/uploads/1401-Code-of-Conduct-Individual-v4.0.pdf> Code of Ethics </a>, and has a NDA over it. This post is NOT about the actual content of the exam. It is merley my experiance with the examination process, and the Techincal syllabus. A copy of the notes for candidates covering the exam type, question examples and such is available from <a href="http://www.crest-approved.org/wp-content/uploads/crest-notes-for-candidates-CPSA.pdf"> here </a> and the techinical syllabus is available <a href="http://www.crest-approved.org/wp-content/uploads/Technical_Syllabus-CREST_Practitioner-v1-1.pdf">. Please check the <a href="http://www.crest-approved.org/professional-examinations/practitioner-security-analyst/index.html"> CPSA Page </a> on the crest website for the most upto date version of the notes for candiates and the Technical Syllabus. If anything on this page is deemed against the Code of Ethics or the Non Disclosure agreement or section 1.2 of the notes for candidates then please contact me and so we can discuss what needs removing. As of the 13th of March no content has been removed.

A quick TL;DR for this is that personally I found the exam syllabus intersting, a good intro into the CREST way of doing exams. The hard part of this exam for me was the time management for the 240 questions in the time allocated.

One of the ways I personally study for exams is I keep a note of headings of everything i need to know. This allows for quick referance and an insight into what i need to know. I have attched my keepnote notes to this page in case anybody finds this usefull. These is following the 1.0 sylabous ONLY, it has not been modifed with anything taken from the exam paper itself.
